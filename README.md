tl;dr: These days I read a lot of romance books, and I keep a bunch of metadata about them.
This repo contains the code I use to help manage that.

My tracking spreadsheet is here:

There's an appified version here:

## Play Nice

Some code here works with unpublished APIs, or performs HTML scraping, or similar techniques which the content owners may tolerate, but likely would not want to see abused.
Please don't be an ass and ruin things for us all.
